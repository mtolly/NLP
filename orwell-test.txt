there will be no love , except the love of big brother .
there will be no laughter , except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy .
there will be no art , no literature , no science .
when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science .
there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness .
there will be no curiosity , no enjoyment of the process of life .
all competing pleasures will be destroyed .
but always - do not forget this , winston - always there will be the intoxication of power , constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler .
always , at every moment , there will be the thrill of victory , the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless .
if you want a picture of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face - for ever .
he paused as though he expected winston to speak .
winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again .
he could not say anything .
his heart seemed to be frozen .
o'brien went on :
and remember that it is for ever .
the face will always be there to be stamped upon .
the heretic , the enemy of society , will always be there , so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again .
everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands - all that will continue , and worse .
the espionage , the betrayals , the arrests , the tortures , the executions , the disappearances will never cease .
it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph .
the more the party is powerful , the less it will be tolerant : the weaker the opposition , the tighter the despotism .
goldstein and his heresies will live for ever .
every day , at every moment , they will be defeated , discredited , ridiculed , spat upon and yet they will always survive .
this drama that i have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation , always in subtler forms .
always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy , screaming with pain , broken up , contemptible - and in the end utterly penitent , saved from himself , crawling to our feet of his own accord .
that is the world that we are preparing , winston .
a world of victory after victory , triumph after triumph after triumph : an endless pressing , pressing , pressing upon the nerve of power .
you are beginning , i can see , to realize what that world will be like .
but in the end you will do more than understand it .
you will accept it , welcome it , become part of it .
winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak .
you can't ! he said weakly .
what do you mean by that remark , winston ?
you could not create such a world as you have just described .
it is a dream .
it is impossible .
why ?
it is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty .
it would never endure .
why not ?
it would have no vitality .
it would disintegrate .
it would commit suicide .
nonsense .
you are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love .
why should it be ?
and if it were , what difference would that make ?
suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster .
suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty .
still what difference would it make ?
can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death ?
the party is immortal .
as usual , the voice had battered winston into helplessness .
moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement o'brien would twist the dial again .
and yet he could not keep silent .
feebly , without arguments , with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what o'brien had said , he returned to the attack .
i don't know - i don't care .
somehow you will fail .
something will defeat you .
life will defeat you .
we control life , winston , at all its levels .
you are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us .
but we create human nature .
men are infinitely malleable .
or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us .
put it out of your mind .
they are helpless , like the animals .
humanity is the party .
the others are outside - irrelevant .
i don't care .
in the end they will beat you .
sooner or later they will see you for what you are , and then they will tear you to pieces .
do you see any evidence that that is happening ?
or any reason why it should ?
no .
i believe it .
i know that you will fail .
there is something in the universe - i don't know , some spirit , some principle - that you will never overcome .
do you believe in god , winston ?
no .
then what is it , this principle that will defeat us ?
i don't know .
the spirit of man .
and do you consider yourself a man ?
yes .
if you are a man , winston , you are the last man .
your kind is extinct ; we are the inheritors .
do you understand that you are alone ?
you are outside history , you are non-existent .
his manner changed and he said more harshly : and you consider yourself morally superior to us , with our lies and our cruelty ?
yes , i consider myself superior .
o'brien did not speak .
two other voices were speaking .
after a moment winston recognized one of them as his own .
it was a sound-track of the conversation he had had with o'brien , on the night when he had enrolled himself in the brotherhood .
he heard himself promising to lie , to steal , to forge , to murder , to encourage drug-taking and prostitution , to disseminate venereal diseases , to throw vitriol in a child 's face .
o'brien made a small impatient gesture , as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making .
then he turned a switch and the voices stopped .
get up from that bed , he said .
the bonds had loosened themselves .
winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily .
you are the last man , said o'brien .
you are the guardian of the human spirit .
you shall see yourself as you are .
take off your clothes .
winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together .
the zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them .
he could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time .
beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags , just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes .
as he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room .
he approached it , then stopped short .
an involuntary cry had broken out of him .
go on , said o'brien .
stand between the wings of the mirror .
you shall see the side view as well .
he had stopped because he was frightened .
a bowed , greycoloured , skeleton-like thing was coming towards him .
its actual appearance was frightening , and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself .
he moved closer to the glass .
the creature 's face seemed to be protruded , because of its bent carriage .
a forlorn , jailbird 's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp , a crooked nose , and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful .
the cheeks were seamed , the mouth had a drawn-in look .
certainly it was his own face , but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside .
the emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt .
he had gone partially bald .
for the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well , but it was only the scalp that was grey .
except for his hands and a circle of his face , his body was grey all over with ancient , ingrained dirt .
here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds , and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it .
but the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body .
the barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton : the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs .
he saw now what o'brien had meant about seeing the side view .
the curvature of the spine was astonishing .
the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest , the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull .
at a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty , suffering from some malignant disease .
you have thought sometimes , said o'brien , that my face - the face of a member of the inner party - looks old and worn .
what do you think of your own face ?
he seized winston 's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him .
look at the condition you are in ! he said .
look at this filthy grime all over your body .
look at the dirt between your toes .
look at that disgusting running sore on your leg .
do you know that you stink like a goat ?
probably you have ceased to notice it .
look at your emaciation .
do you see ?
i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep .
i could snap your neck like a carrot .
do you know that you have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our hands ?
even your hair is coming out in handfuls .
look !
he plucked at winston 's head and brought away a tuft of hair .
open your mouth .
nine , ten , eleven teeth left .
how many had you when you came to us ?
and the few you have left are dropping out of your head .
look here !
he seized one of winston 's remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger .
a twinge of pain shot through winston 's jaw .
o'brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots .
he tossed it across the cell .
you are rotting away , he said ; you are falling to pieces .
what are you ?
a bag of filth .
now turn around and look into that mirror again .
do you see that thing facing you ?
that is the last man .
if you are human , that is humanity .
now put your clothes on again .
winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements .
until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was .
only one thought stirred in his mind : that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined .
then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him .
before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears .
he was aware of his ugliness , his gracelessness , a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light : but he could not stop himself .
o'brien laid a hand on his shoulder , almost kindly .
it will not last for ever , he said .
you can escape from it whenever you choose .
everything depends on yourself .
you did it ! sobbed winston .
you reduced me to this state .
no , winston , you reduced yourself to it .
this is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the party .
it was all contained in that first act .
nothing has happened that you did not foresee .
he paused , and then went on :
we have beaten you , winston .
we have broken you up .
you have seen what your body is like .
your mind is in the same state .
i do not think there can be much pride left in you .
you have been kicked and flogged and insulted , you have screamed with pain , you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit .
you have whimpered for mercy , you have betrayed everybody and everything .
can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you ?
winston had stopped weeping , though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes .
he looked up at o'brien .
i have not betrayed julia , he said .
o'brien looked down at him thoughtfully .
no , he said ; no ; that is perfectly true .
you have not betrayed julia .
the peculiar reverence for o'brien , which nothing seemed able to destroy , flooded winston 's heart again .
how intelligent , he thought , how intelligent !
never did o'brien fail to understand what was said to him .
anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed julia .
for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture ?
he had told them everything he knew about her , her habits , her character , her past life ; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings , all that he had said to her and she to him , their black-market meals , their adulteries , their vague plottings against the party - everything .
and yet , in the sense in which he intended the word , he had not betrayed her .
he had not stopped loving her ; his feelings towards her had remained the same .
o'brien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation .
tell me , he said , how soon will they shoot me ?
it might be a long time , said o'brien .
you are a difficult case .
but don't give up hope .
everyone is cured sooner or later .
in the end we shall shoot you .
he was much better .
he was growing fatter and stronger every day , if it was proper to speak of days .
the white light and the humming sound were the same as ever , but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in .
there was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed , and a stool to sit on .
they had given him a bath , and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin .
they even gave him warm water to wash with .
they had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls .
they had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment .
they had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures .
weeks or months must have passed .
it would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time , if he had felt any interest in doing so , since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals .
he was getting , he judged , three meals in the twenty-four hours ; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day .
the food was surprisingly good , with meat at every third meal .
once there was even a packet of cigarettes .
he had no matches , but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light .
the first time he tried to smoke it made him sick , but he persevered , and spun the packet out for a long time , smoking half a cigarette after each meal .
they had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner .
at first he made no use of it .
even when he was awake he was completely torpid .
often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring , sometimes asleep , sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes .
he had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face .
it seemed to make no difference , except that one 's dreams were more coherent .
he dreamed a great deal all through this time , and they were always happy dreams .
he was in the golden country , or he was sitting among enormous glorious , sunlit ruins , with his mother , with julia , with o'brien - not doing anything , merely sitting in the sun , talking of peaceful things .
such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams .
he seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort , now that the stimulus of pain had been removed .
he was not bored , he had no desire for conversation or distraction .
merely to be alone , not to be beaten or questioned , to have enough to eat , and to be clean all over , was completely satisfying .
by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep , but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed .
all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body .
he would finger himself here and there , trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter .
finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter ; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees .
after that , reluctantly at first , he began exercising himself regularly .
in a little while he could walk three kilometres , measured by pacing the cell , and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter .
he attempted more elaborate exercises , and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do .
he could not move out of a walk , he could not hold his stool out at arm 's length , he could not stand on one leg without falling over .
he squatted down on his heels , and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position .
he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands .
it was hopeless , he could not raise himself a centimetre .
but after a few more days - a few more mealtimes - even that feat was accomplished .
a time came when he could do it six times running .
he began to grow actually proud of his body , and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal .
only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed , ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror .
his mind grew more active .
he sat down on the plank bed , his back against the wall and the slate on his knees , and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself .
he had capitulated , that was agreed .
in reality , as he saw now , he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision .
from the moment when he was inside the ministry of love - and yes , even during those minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do - he had grasped the frivolity , the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party .
he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass .
there was no physical act , no word spoken aloud , that they had not noticed , no train of thought that they had not been able to infer .
even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced .
they had played sound-tracks to him , shown him photographs .
some of them were photographs of julia and himself .
yes , even ... he could not fight against the party any longer .
besides , the party was in the right .
it must be so ; how could the immortal , collective brain be mistaken ?
by what external standard could you check its judgements ?
sanity was statistical .
it was merely a question of learning to think as they thought .
only !
the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers .
he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head .
he wrote first in large clumsy capitals : freedom is slavery .
then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it : two and two make five .
but then there came a sort of check .
his mind , as though shying away from something , seemed unable to concentrate .
he knew that he knew what came next , but for the moment he could not recall it .
when he did recall it , it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be : it did not come of its own accord .
he wrote : god is power .
he accepted everything .
the past was alterable .
the past never had been altered .
oceania was at war with eastasia .
oceania had always been at war with eastasia .
jones , aaronson , and rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with .
he had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt .
it had never existed , he had invented it .
he remembered remembering contrary things , but those were false memories , products of selfdeception .
how easy it all was !
only surrender , and everything else followed .
it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled , and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it .
nothing had changed except your own attitude : the predestined thing happened in any case .
he hardly knew why he had ever rebelled .
everything was easy , except - !
anything could be true .
the so-called laws of nature were nonsense .
the law of gravity was nonsense .
if i wished , o'brien had said , i could float off this floor like a soap bubble .
winston worked it out .
if he thinks he floats off the floor , and if i simultaneously think i see him do it , then the thing happens .
suddenly , like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water , the thought burst into his mind : it doesn't really happen .
we imagine it .
it is hallucination .
he pushed the thought under instantly .
the fallacy was obvious .
it presupposed that somewhere or other , outside oneself , there was a real world where real things happened .
but how could there be such a world ?
what knowledge have we of anything , save through our own minds ?
all happenings are in the mind .
whatever happens in all minds , truly happens .
he had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy , and he was in no danger of succumbing to it .
he realized , nevertheless , that it ought never to have occurred to him .
the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself .
the process should be automatic , instinctive .
crimestop , they called it in newspeak .
he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop .
he presented himself with propositions - the party says the earth is flat , the party says that ice is heavier than water - and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them .
it was not easy .
it needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation .
the arithmetical problems raised , for instance , by such a statement as two and two make five were beyond his intellectual grasp .
it needed also a sort of athleticism of mind , an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors .
stupidity was as necessary as intelligence , and as difficult to attain .
all the while , with one part of his mind , he wondered how soon they would shoot him .
everything depends on yourself , o'brien had said ; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer .
it might be ten minutes hence , or ten years .
they might keep him for years in solitary confinement , they might send him to a labour-camp , they might release him for a while , as they sometimes did .
it was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again .
the one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment .
the tradition - the unspoken tradition : somehow you knew it , though you never heard it said - was that they shot you from behind ; always in the back of the head , without warning , as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell .
one day - but one day was not the right expression ; just as probably it was in the middle of the night : once - he fell into a strange , blissful reverie .
he was walking down the corridor , waiting for the bullet .
he knew that it was coming in another moment .
everything was settled , smoothed out , reconciled .
there were no more doubts , no more arguments , no more pain , no more fear .
his body was healthy and strong .
he walked easily , with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight .
he was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love , he was in the enormous sunlit passage , a kilometre wide , down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs .
he was in the golden country , following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture .
he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face .
at the edge of the field were the elm trees , faintly stirring , and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows .
suddenly he started up with a shock of horror .
the sweat broke out on his backbone .
he had heard himself cry aloud :
julia !
julia !
julia , my love !
julia !
for a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence .
she had seemed to be not merely with him , but inside him .
it was as though she had got into the texture of his skin .
in that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free .
also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help .
he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself .
what had he done ?
how many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness ?
in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside .
they could not let such an outburst go unpunished .
they would know now , if they had not known before , that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them .
he obeyed the party , but he still hated the party .
in the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity .
now he had retreated a step further : in the mind he had surrendered , but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate .
he knew that he was in the wrong , but he preferred to be in the wrong .
they would understand that - o'brien would understand it .
it was all confessed in that single foolish cry .
he would have to start all over again .
it might take years .
he ran a hand over his face , trying to familiarize himself with the new shape .
there were deep furrows in the cheeks , the cheekbones felt sharp , the nose flattened .
besides , since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth .
it was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like .
in any case , mere control of the features was not enough .
for the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself .
you must know all the while that it is there , but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name .
from now onwards he must not only think right ; he must feel right , dream right .
and all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him , a kind of cyst .
one day they would decide to shoot him .
you could not tell when it would happen , but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess .
it was always from behind , walking down a corridor .
ten seconds would be enough .
in that time the world inside him could turn over .
and then suddenly , without a word uttered , without a check in his step , without the changing of a line in his face - suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang ! would go the batteries of his hatred .
hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame .
and almost in the same instant bang ! would go the bullet , too late , or too early .
they would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it .
the heretical thought would be unpunished , unrepented , out of their reach for ever .
they would have blown a hole in their own perfection .
to die hating them , that was freedom .
he shut his eyes .
it was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline .
it was a question of degrading himself , mutilating himself .
he had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth .
what was the most horrible , sickening thing of all ?
he thought of big brother .
the enormous face ( because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide ) , with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro , seemed to float into his mind of its own accord .
what were his true feelings towards big brother ?
there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage .
the steel door swung open with a clang .
o'brien walked into the cell .
behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the black-uniformed guards .
get up , said o'brien .
come here .
winston stood opposite him .
o'brien took winston 's shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely .
you have had thoughts of deceiving me , he said .
that was stupid .
stand up straighter .
look me in the face .
he paused , and went on in a gentler tone :
you are improving .
intellectually there is very little wrong with you .
it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress .
tell me , winston - and remember , no lies : you know that i am always able to detect a lie - tell me , what are your true feelings towards big brother ?
i hate him .
you hate him .
good .
then the time has come for you to take the last step .
you must love big brother .
it is not enough to obey him : you must love him .
he released winston with a little push towards the guards .
room 101 , he said .
at each stage of his imprisonment he had known , or seemed to know , whereabouts he was in the windowless building .
possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure .
the cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level .
the room where he had been interrogated by o'brien was high up near the roof .
this place was many metres underground , as deep down as it was possible to go .
it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in .
but he hardly noticed his surroundings .
all he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him , each covered with green baize .
one was only a metre or two from him , the other was further away , near the door .
he was strapped upright in a chair , so tightly that he could move nothing , not even his head .
a sort of pad gripped his head from behind , forcing him to look straight in front of him .
for a moment he was alone , then the door opened and o'brien came in .
you asked me once , said o'brien , what was in room 101 .
i told you that you knew the answer already .
everyone knows it .
the thing that is in room 101 is the worst thing in the world .
the door opened again .
a guard came in , carrying something made of wire , a box or basket of some kind .
he set it down on the further table .
because of the position in which o'brien was standing , winston could not see what the thing was .
the worst thing in the world , said o'brien , varies from individual to individual .
it may be burial alive , or death by fire , or by drowning , or by impalement , or fifty other deaths .
there are cases where it is some quite trivial thing , not even fatal .
he had moved a little to one side , so that winston had a better view of the thing on the table .
it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by .
fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask , with the concave side outwards .
although it was three or four metres away from him , he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments , and that there was some kind of creature in each .
they were rats .
in your case , said o'brien , the worst thing in the world happens to be rats .
a sort of premonitory tremor , a fear of he was not certain what , had passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage .
but at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him .
his bowels seemed to turn to water .
you can't do that ! he cried out in a high cracked voice .
you couldn't , you couldn't !
it 's impossible .
do you remember , said o'brien , the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams ?
there was a wall of blackness in front of you , and a roaring sound in your ears .
there was something terrible on the other side of the wall .
you knew that you knew what it was , but you dared not drag it into the open .
it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall .
o'brien ! said winston , making an effort to control his voice .
you know this is not necessary .
what is it that you want me to do ?
o'brien made no direct answer .
when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected .
he looked thoughtfully into the distance , as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind winston 's back .
by itself , he said , pain is not always enough .
there are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain , even to the point of death .
but for everyone there is something unendurable - something that cannot be contemplated .
courage and cowardice are not involved .
if you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope .
if you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air .
it is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed .
it is the same with the rats .
for you , they are unendurable .
they are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand . even if you wished to .
you will do what is required of you .
but what is it , what is it ?
how can i do it if i don't know what it is ?
o'brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table .
he set it down carefully on the baize cloth .
winston could hear the blood singing in his ears .
he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness .
he was in the middle of a great empty plain , a flat desert drenched with sunlight , across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances .
yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him .
they were enormous rats .
they were at the age when a rat 's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey .
the rat , said o'brien , still addressing his invisible audience , although a rodent , is carnivorous .
you are aware of that .
you will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town .
in some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house , even for five minutes .
the rats are certain to attack it .
within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones .
they also attack sick or dying people .
they show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless .
there was an outburst of squeals from the cage .
it seemed to reach winston from far away .
the rats were fighting ; they were trying to get at each other through the partition .
he heard also a deep groan of despair .
that , too , seemed to come from outside himself .
o'brien picked up the cage , and , as he did so , pressed something in it .
there was a sharp click .
winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair .
it was hopeless ; every part of him , even his head , was held immovably .
o'brien moved the cage nearer .
it was less than a metre from winston 's face .
i have pressed the first lever , said o'brien .
you understand the construction of this cage .
the mask will fit over your head , leaving no exit .
when i press this other lever , the door of the cage will slide up .
these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets .
have you ever seen a rat leap through the air ?
they will leap on to your face and bore straight into it .
sometimes they attack the eyes first .
sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue .
the cage was nearer ; it was closing in .
winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head .
but he fought furiously against his panic .
to think , to think , even with a split second left - to think was the only hope .
suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils .
there was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him , and he almost lost consciousness .
everything had gone black .
for an instant he was insane , a screaming animal .
yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea .
there was one and only one way to save himself .
he must interpose another human being , the body of another human being , between himself and the rats .
the circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else .
the wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face .
the rats knew what was coming now .
one of them was leaping up and down , the other , an old scaly grandfather of the sewers , stood up , with his pink hands against the bars , and fiercely sniffed the air .
winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth .
again the black panic took hold of him .
he was blind , helpless , mindless .
it was a common punishment in imperial china , said o'brien as didactically as ever .
the mask was closing on his face .
the wire brushed his cheek .
and then - no , it was not relief , only hope , a tiny fragment of hope .
too late , perhaps too late .
but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment - one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats .
and he was shouting frantically , over and over .
do it to julia !
do it to julia !
not me !
julia !
i don't care what you do to her .
tear her face off , strip her to the bones .
not me !
julia !
not me !
he was falling backwards , into enormous depths , away from the rats .
he was still strapped in the chair , but he had fallen through the floor , through the walls of the building , through the earth , through the oceans , through the atmosphere , into outer space , into the gulfs between the stars - always away , away , away from the rats .
he was light years distant , but o'brien was still standing at his side .
there was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek .
but through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click , and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open .
the chestnut tree was almost empty .
a ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops .
it was the lonely hour of fifteen .
a tinny music trickled from the telescreens .
winston sat in his usual corner , gazing into an empty glass .
now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall .
big brother is watching you , the caption said .
unbidden , a waiter came and filled his glass up with victory gin , shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork .
it was saccharine flavoured with cloves , the speciality of the caf&#x0e9; .
winston was listening to the telescreen .
at present only music was coming out of it , but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace .
the news from the african front was disquieting in the extreme .
on and off he had been worrying about it all day .
a eurasian army ( oceania was at war with eurasia : oceania had always been at war with eurasia ) was moving southward at terrifying speed .
the mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite area , but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was a battlefield .
brazzaville and leopoldville were in danger .
one did not have to look at the map to see what it meant .
it was not merely a question of losing central africa : for the first time in the whole war , the territory of oceania itself was menaced .
a violent emotion , not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement , flared up in him , then faded again .
he stopped thinking about the war .
in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time .
he picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp .
as always , the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly .
the stuff was horrible .
the cloves and saccharine , themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way , could not disguise the flat oily smell ; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin , which dwelt with him night and day , was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those -
he never named them , even in his thoughts , and so far as it was possible he never visualized them .
they were something that he was half-aware of , hovering close to his face , a smell that clung to his nostrils .
as the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips .
he had grown fatter since they released him , and had regained his old colour - indeed , more than regained it .
his features had thickened , the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red , even the bald scalp was too deep a pink .
a waiter , again unbidden , brought the chessboard and the current issue of the times , with the page turned down at the chess problem .
then , seeing that winston 's glass was empty , he brought the gin bottle and filled it .
there was no need to give orders .
they knew his habits .
the chessboard was always waiting for him , his corner table was always reserved ; even when the place was full he had it to himself , since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him .
he never even bothered to count his drinks .
at irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill , but he had the impression that they always undercharged him .
it would have made no difference if it had been the other way about .
he had always plenty of money nowadays .
he even had a job , a sinecure , more highly-paid than his old job had been .
the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over .
winston raised his head to listen .
no bulletins from the front , however .
it was merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty .
in the preceding quarter , it appeared , the tenth three year plan 's quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by 98 per cent .
he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces .
it was a tricky ending , involving a couple of knights .
white to play and mate in two moves .
winston looked up at the portrait of big brother .
white always mates , he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism .
always , without exception , it is so arranged .
in no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won .
did it not symbolize the eternal , unvarying triumph of good over evil ?
the huge face gazed back at him , full of calm power .
white always mates .
the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone : you are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty .
fifteen-thirty !
this is news of the highest importance .
take care not to miss it .
fifteen-thirty !
the tinking music struck up again .
winston 's heart stirred .
that was the bulletin from the front ; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming .
all day , with little spurts of excitement , the thought of a smashing defeat in africa had been in and out of his mind .
he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of africa like a column of ants .
why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way ?
the outline of the west african coast stood out vividly in his mind .
he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board .
there was the proper spot .
even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force , mysteriously assembled , suddenly planted in their rear , cutting their communications by land and sea .
he felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence .
but it was necessary to act quickly .
if they could get control of the whole of africa , if they had airfields and submarine bases at the cape , it would cut oceania in two .
it might mean anything : defeat , breakdown , the redivision of the world , the destruction of the party !
he drew a deep breath .
an extraordinary medley of feeling - but it was not a medley , exactly ; rather it was successive layers of feeling , in which one could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside him .
the spasm passed .
he put the white knight back in its place , but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem .
his thoughts wandered again .
almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table : 2+2=5 .
they can't get inside you , she had said .
but they could get inside you .
what happens to you here is for ever , o'brien had said .
that was a true word .
there were things , your own acts , from which you could never recover .
something was killed in your breast : burnt out , cauterized out .
he had seen her ; he had even spoken to her .
there was no danger in it .
he knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings .
he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to .
actually it was by chance that they had met .
it was in the park , on a vile , biting day in march , when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind .
he was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him .
it struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way .
they almost passed one another without a sign , then he turned and followed her , not very eagerly .
he knew that there was no danger , nobody would take any interest in him .
she did not speak .
she walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him , then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side .
presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs , useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind .
they halted .
it was vilely cold .
the wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional , dirty-looking crocuses .
he put his arm round her waist .
there was no telescreen , but there must be hidden microphones : besides , they could be seen .
it did not matter , nothing mattered .
they could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to .
his flesh froze with horror at the thought of it .
she made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm ; she did not even try to disengage herself .
he knew now what had changed in her .
her face was sallower , and there was a long scar , partly hidden by the hair , across her forehead and temple ; but that was not the change .
it was that her waist had grown thicker , and , in a surprising way , had stiffened .
he remembered how once , after the explosion of a rocket bomb , he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins , and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing , but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle , which made it seem more like stone than flesh .
her body felt like that .
it occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been .
he did not attempt to kiss her , nor did they speak .
as they walked back across the grass , she looked directly at him for the first time .
it was only a momentary glance , full of contempt and dislike .
he wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes .
they sat down on two iron chairs , side by side but not too close together .
he saw that she was about to speak .
she moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig .
her feet seemed to have grown broader , he noticed .
i betrayed you , she said baldly .
i betrayed you , he said .
she gave him another quick look of dislike .
sometimes , she said , they threaten you with something something you can't stand up to , can't even think about .
and then you say , don't do it to me , do it to somebody else , do it to so-and-so .
and perhaps you might pretend , afterwards , that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn't really mean it .
but that isn't true .
at the time when it happens you do mean it .
you think there 's no other way of saving yourself , and you 're quite ready to save yourself that way .
you want it to happen to the other person .
you don't give a damn what they suffer .
all you care about is yourself .
all you care about is yourself , he echoed .
and after that , you don't feel the same towards the other person any longer .
no , he said , you don't feel the same .
there did not seem to be anything more to say .
the wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies .
almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence : besides , it was too cold to keep still .
she said something about catching her tube and stood up to go .
we must meet again , he said .
yes , she said , we must meet again .
he followed irresolutely for a little distance , half a pace behind her .
they did not speak again .
she did not actually try to shake him off , but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her .
he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube station , but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable .
he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree caf&#x0e9; , which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment .
he had a nostalgic vision of his corner table , with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin .
above all , it would be warm in there .
the next moment , not altogether by accident , he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people .
he made a halfhearted attempt to catch up , then slowed down , turned , and made off in the opposite direction .
when he had gone fifty metres he looked back .
the street was not crowded , but already he could not distinguish her .
any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers .
perhaps her thickened , stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind .
at the time when it happens , she had said , you do mean it .
he had meant it .
he had not merely said it , he had wished it .
he had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the -
something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen .
a cracked and jeering note , a yellow note , came into it .
and then - perhaps it was not happening , perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound - a voice was singing :
under the spreading chestnut tree
i sold you and you sold me
the tears welled up in his eyes .
a passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle .
he took up his glass and sniffed at it .
the stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank .
but it had become the element he swam in .
it was his life , his death , and his resurrection .
it was gin that sank him into stupor every night , and gin that revived him every morning .
when he woke , seldom before eleven hundred , with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken , it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight .
through the midday hours he sat with glazed face , the bottle handy , listening to the telescreen .
from fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the chestnut tree .
no one cared what he did any longer , no whistle woke him , no telescreen admonished him .
occasionally , perhaps twice a week , he went to a dusty , forgotten-looking office in the ministry of truth and did a little work , or what was called work .
he had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary .
they were engaged in producing something called an interim report , but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out .
it was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets , or outside .
there were four others on the committee , all of them persons similar to himself .
there were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again , frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done .
but there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly , making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished - when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse , with subtle haggling over definitions , enormous digressions , quarrels threats , even , to appeal to higher authority .
and then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes , like ghosts fading at cock-crow .
the telescreen was silent for a moment .
winston raised his head again .
the bulletin !
but no , they were merely changing the music .
he had the map of africa behind his eyelids .
the movement of the armies was a diagram : a black arrow tearing vertically southward , and a white arrow horizontally eastward , across the tail of the first .
as though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait .
was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist ?
his interest flagged again .
he drank another mouthful of gin , picked up the white knight and made a tentative move .
check .
but it was evidently not the right move , because
uncalled , a memory floated into his mind .
he saw a candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed , and himself , a boy of nine or ten , sitting on the floor , shaking a dice-box , and laughing excitedly .
his mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing .
it must have been about a month before she disappeared .
it was a moment of reconciliation , when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived .
he remembered the day well , a pelting , drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by .
the boredom of the two children in the dark , cramped bedroom became unbearable .
winston whined and grizzled , made futile demands for food , fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall , while the younger child wailed intermittently .
in the end his mother said , now be good , and i 'll buy you a toy .
a lovely toy - you 'll love it ; and then she had gone out in the rain , to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby , and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders .
he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard .
it was a miserable outfit .
the board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides .
winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest .
but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play .
soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again , almost to the starting-point .
they played eight games , winning four each .
his tiny sister , too young to understand what the game was about , had sat propped up against a bolster , laughing because the others were laughing .
for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together , as in his earlier childhood .
he pushed the picture out of his mind .
it was a false memory .
he was troubled by false memories occasionally .
they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were .
some things had happened , others had not happened .
he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again .
almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter .
he had started as though a pin had run into him .
a shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air .
it was the bulletin !
victory !
it always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news .
a sort of electric drill ran through the caf&#x0e9; .
even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears .
the trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise .
already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen , but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside .
the news had run round the streets like magic .
he could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened , as he had foreseen ; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy 's rear , the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black .
fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din : vast strategic manoeuvre - perfect co-ordination - utter rout - half a million prisoners - complete demoralization - control of the whole of africa - bring the war within measurable distance of its end victory - greatest victory in human history - victory , victory , victory !
under the table winston 's feet made convulsive movements .
he had not stirred from his seat , but in his mind he was running , swiftly running , he was with the crowds outside , cheering himself deaf .
he looked up again at the portrait of big brother .
the colossus that bestrode the world !
the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain !
he thought how ten minutes ago - yes , only ten minutes - there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat .
ah , it was more than a eurasian army that had perished !
much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love , but the final , indispensable , healing change had never happened , until this moment .
the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter , but the shouting outside had died down a little .
the waiters were turning back to their work .
one of them approached with the gin bottle .
winston , sitting in a blissful dream , paid no attention as his glass was filled up .
he was not running or cheering any longer .
he was back in the ministry of love , with everything forgiven , his soul white as snow .
he was in the public dock , confessing everything , implicating everybody .
he was walking down the white-tiled corridor , with the feeling of walking in sunlight , and an armed guard at his back .
the longhoped-for bullet was entering his brain .
he gazed up at the enormous face .
forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache .
o cruel , needless misunderstanding !
o stubborn , self-willed exile from the loving breast !
two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose .
but it was all right , everything was all right , the struggle was finished .
he had won the victory over himself .
he loved big brother .
newspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc , or english socialism .
in the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication , either in speech or writing .
the leading articles in the times were written in it , but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist .
it was expected that newspeak would have finally superseded oldspeak ( or standard english , as we should call it ) by about the year 2050 .
meanwhile it gained ground steadily , all party members tending to use newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech .
the version in use in 1984 , and embodied in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary , was a provisional one , and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later .
it is with the final , perfected version , as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionary , that we are concerned here .
the purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsoc , but to make all other modes of thought impossible .
it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten , a heretical thought - that is , a thought diverging from the principles of ingsoc - should be literally unthinkable , at least so far as thought is dependent on words .
its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express , while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods .
this was done partly by the invention of new words , but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings , and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever .
to give a single example .
the word free still existed in newspeak , but it could only be used in such statements as this dog is free from lice or this field is free from weeds .
it could not be used in its old sense of politically free or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts , and were therefore of necessity nameless .
quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words , reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself , and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive .
newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought , and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum .
newspeak was founded on the english language as we now know it , though many newspeak sentences , even when not containing newly-created words , would be barely intelligible to an english-speaker of our own day .
newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes , known as the a vocabulary , the b vocabulary ( also called compound words ) , and the c vocabulary .
it will be simpler to discuss each class separately , but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary , since the same rules held good for all three categories .
the a vocabulary .
the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life - for such things as eating , drinking , working , putting on one 's clothes , going up and down stairs , riding in vehicles , gardening , cooking , and the like .
it was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit , run , dog , tree , sugar , house , field - but in comparison with the present-day english vocabulary their number was extremely small , while their meanings were far more rigidly defined .
all ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them .
so far as it could be achieved , a newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept .
it would have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion .
it was intended only to express simple , purposive thoughts , usually involving concrete objects or physical actions .
the grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities .
the first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech .
any word in the language ( in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when ) could be used either as verb , noun , adjective , or adverb .
between the verb and the noun form , when they were of the same root , there was never any variation , this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms .
the word thought , for example , did not exist in newspeak .
its place was taken by think , which did duty for both noun and verb .
no etymological principle was followed here : in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention , in other cases the verb .
even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected , one or other of them was frequently suppressed .
there was , for example , no such word as cut , its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife .
adjectives were formed by adding the suffix - ful to the noun-verb , and adverbs by adding - wise .
thus for example , speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly .
certain of our present-day adjectives , such as good , strong , big , black , soft , were retained , but their total number was very small .
there was little need for them , since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding - ful to a noun-verb .
none of the now-existing adverbs was retained , except for a very few already ending in - wise : the - wise termination was invariable .
the word well , for example , was replaced by goodwise .
in addition , any word - this again applied in principle to every word in the language - could be negatived by adding the affix un - or could be strengthened by the affix plus - , or , for still greater emphasis , doubleplus - .
thus , for example , uncold meant warm , while pluscold and doublepluscold meant , respectively , very cold and superlatively cold .
it was also possible , as in present-day english , to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante - , post - , up - , down - etc.
by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary .
given , for instance , the word good , there was no need for such a word as bad , since the required meaning was equally well - indeed , better - expressed by ungood .
all that was necessary , in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites , was to decide which of them to suppress .
dark , for example , could be replaced by unlight , or light by undark , according to preference .
the second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularity .
subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules .
thus , in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in - ed .
the preterite of steal was stealed , the preterite of think was thinked , and so on throughout the language , all such forms as swam , gave , brought , spoke , taken , etc. , being abolished .
all plurals were made by adding - s or - es as the case might be .
the plurals of man , ox , life , were mans , oxes , lifes .
comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding - er , - est ( good , gooder , goodest ) , irregular forms and the more , most formation being suppressed .
the only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns , the relatives , the demonstrative adjectives , and the auxiliary verbs .
all of these followed their ancient usage , except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary , and the shall , should tenses had been dropped , all their uses being covered by will and would .
there were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech .
a word which was difficult to utter , or was liable to be incorrectly heard , was held to be ipso_facto a bad word : occasionally therefore , for the sake of euphony , extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained .
but this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the b vocabulary .
why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay .
the b vocabulary .
the b vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes : words , that is to say , which not only had in every case a political implication , but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them .
without a full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly .
in some cases they could be translated into oldspeak , or even into words taken from the a vocabulary , but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones .
the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand , often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables , and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language .
the b words were in all cases compound words .
they consisted of two or more words , or portions of words , welded together in an easily pronounceable form .
the resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb , and inflected according to the ordinary rules .
to take a single example : the word goodthink , meaning , very roughly , orthodoxy , or , if one chose to regard it as a verb , to think in an orthodox manner .
this inflected as follows : noun-verb , goodthink ; past tense and past participle , goodthinked ; present participle , good-thinking ; adjective , goodthinkful ; adverb , goodthinkwise ; verbal noun , goodthinker .
the b words were not constructed on any etymological plan .
the words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech , and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation .
in the word crimethink ( thoughtcrime ) , for instance , the think came second , whereas in thinkpol ( thought police ) it came first , and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable .
because of the great difficulty in securing euphony , irregular formations were commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary .
for example , the adjective forms of minitrue , minipax , and miniluv were , respectively , minitruthful , minipeaceful , and minilovely , simply because - trueful , - paxful , and - loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce .
in principle , however , all b words could inflect , and all inflected in exactly the same way .
some of the b words had highly subtilized meanings , barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole .
consider , for example , such a typical sentence from a times leading article as oldthinkers unbellyfeel ingsoc .
the shortest rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be : those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of english socialism .
but this is not an adequate translation .
to begin with , in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above , one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc .
and in addition , only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel , which implied a blind , enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today ; or of the word oldthink , which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence .
but the special function of certain newspeak words , of which oldthink was one , was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them .
these words , necessarily few in number , had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which , as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term , could now be scrapped and forgotten .
the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words , but , having invented them , to make sure what they meant : to make sure , that is to say , what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence .
as we have already seen in the case of the word free , words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience , but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them .
countless other words such as honour , justice , morality , internationalism , democracy , science , an religion had simply ceased to exist .
a few blanket words covered them , and , in covering them , abolished them .
all words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality , for instance , were contained in the single word crimethink , while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink .
greater precision would have been dangerous .
what was required in a party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who knew , without knowing much else , that all nations other than his own worshipped false gods .
he did not need to know that these gods were called baal , osiris , moloch , ashtaroth , and the like : probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy .
he knew jehovah and the commandments of jehovah : he knew , therefore , that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods .
in somewhat the same way , the party member knew what constituted right conduct , and in exceedingly vague , generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible .
his sexual life , for example , was entirely regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime ( sexual immorality ) and goodsex ( chastity ) .
sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever .
it covered fornication , adultery , homosexuality , and other perversions , and , in addition , normal intercourse practised for its own sake .
there was no need to enumerate them separately , since they were all equally culpable , and , in principle , all punishable by death .
in the c vocabulary , which consisted of scientific and technical words , it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations , but the ordinary citizen had no need of them .
he knew what was meant by goodsex - that is to say , normal intercourse between man and wife , for the sole purpose of begetting children , and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman : all else was sexcrime .
in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical : beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent .
no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral .
a great many were euphemisms .
such words , for instance , as joycamp ( forced-labour camp ) or minipax ministry of peace , i._e. ministry of war ) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean .
some words , on the other hand , displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society .
an example was prolefeed , meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses .
other words , again , were ambivalent , having the connotation good when applied to the party and bad when applied to its enemies .
but in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning , but from their structure .
so far as it could be contrived , everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary .
the name of every organization , or body of people , or doctrine , or country , or institution , or public building , was invariably cut down into the familiar shape ; that is , a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation .
in the ministry of truth , for example , the records department , in which winston smith worked , was called recdep , the fiction department was called ficdep , the teleprogrammes department was called teledep , and so on .
this was not done solely with the object of saving time .
even in the early decades of the twentieth century , telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language ; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations .
examples were such words as nazi , gestapo , comintern , inprecorr , agitprop .
in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively , but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose .
it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning , by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it .
the words communist international , for instance , call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood , red flags , barricades , karl marx , and the paris commune .
the word comintern , on the other hand , suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine .
it refers to something almost as easily recognized , and as limited in purpose , as a chair or a table .
comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought , whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily .
in the same way , the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth .
this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible , but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable .
in newspeak , euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning .
regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary .
and rightly so , since what was required , above all for political purposes , was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker 's mind .
the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike .
almost invariably these words - goodthink , minipax , prolefeed , sexcrime , joycamp , ingsoc , bellyfeel , thinkpol , and countless others - were words of two or three syllables , with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last .
the use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech , at once staccato and monotonous .
and this was exactly what was aimed at .
the intention was to make speech , and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral , as nearly as possible independent of consciousness .
for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary , or sometimes necessary , to reflect before speaking , but a party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets .
his training fitted him to do this , the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument , and the texture of the words , with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc , assisted the process still further .
so did the fact of having very few words to choose from .
relative to our own , the newspeak vocabulary was tiny , and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised .
newspeak , indeed , differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year .
each reduction was a gain , since the smaller the area of choice , the smaller the temptation to take thought .
ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all .
this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak , meaning to quack like a duck .
like various other words in the b vocabulary , duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning .
provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones , it implied nothing but praise , and when the times referred to one of the orators of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment .
the c vocabulary .
the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms .
these resembled the scientific terms in use today , and were constructed from the same roots , but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings .
they followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies .
very few of the c words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech .
any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality , but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists .
only a very few words were common to all lists , and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of science as a habit of mind , or a method of thought , irrespective of its particular branches .
there was , indeed , no word for science , any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc .
from the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions , above a very low level , was well-nigh impossible .
it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind , a species of blasphemy .
it would have been possible , for example , to say big brother is ungood .
but this statement , which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity , could not have been sustained by reasoned argument , because the necessary words were not available .
ideas inimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form , and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so .
one could , in fact , only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into oldspeak .
for example , all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence , but only in the same sense in which all men are redhaired is a possible oldspeak sentence .
it did not contain a grammatical error , but it expressed a palpable untruth - i.e. that all men are of equal size , weight , or strength .
the concept of political equality no longer existed , and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal .
in 1984 , when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication , the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings .
in practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this , but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished .
a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of politically equal , or that free had once meant intellectually free , than for instance , a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook .
there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit , simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable .
and it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of newspeak would become more and more pronounced - its words growing fewer and fewer , their meanings more and more rigid , and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing .
when oldspeak had been once and for all superseded , the last link with the past would have been severed .
history had already been rewritten , but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there , imperfectly censored , and so long as one retained one 's knowledge of oldspeak it was possible to read them .
in the future such fragments , even if they chanced to survive , would be unintelligible and untranslatable .
it was impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action , or was already orthodox ( goodthinkful would be the newspeak expression ) in tendency .
in practice this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole .
pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation - that is , alteration in sense as well as language .
take for example the well-known passage from the declaration of independence :
we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their powers from the consent of the governed .
that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it , and to institute new government ...
it would have been quite impossible to render this into newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original .
the nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink .
a full translation could only be an ideological translation , whereby jefferson 's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government .
a good deal of the literature of the past was , indeed , already being transformed in this way .
considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures , while at the same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of ingsoc .
various writers , such as shakespeare , milton , swift , byron , dickens , and some others were therefore in process of translation : when the task had been completed , their original writings , with all else that survived of the literature of the past , would be destroyed .
these translations were a slow and difficult business , and it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century .
there were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature - indispensable technical manuals , and the like - that had to be treated in the same way .
it was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050 .
